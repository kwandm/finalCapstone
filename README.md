Project Description:

The Cipher Encoder project is a simple program that lets you encode messages using a special code. When you give the program a message, it will change each letter by shifting it 15 positions ahead in the alphabet. For example, 'a' becomes 'p' and 'p' becomes 'e'.

The project shows how important it is to protect information by using encryption techniques. Encoding messages helps keep them private and secure from unauthorized access.

Key Features:

Encoding Function: The project has a function that takes your message and encodes it using the special code.
Cyclical Nature: The code takes into account that the alphabet wraps around, so it works even when reaching the end of the alphabet.
Handling Capitalization: The encoding function works for both uppercase and lowercase letters, keeping the original letter case in the encoded message.
Preserving Spaces and Punctuation: Spaces and punctuation marks remain the same in the encoded message. This ensures the encoded message keeps its original structure and can still be understood.
To use the Cipher Encoder project, you simply enter your message, and the program will encode it using the special code. The encoded message will be shown, allowing you to share or store it securely.

Please note that implementing the project may involve researching ASCII values to convert letters to numbers and handling different cases like capital letters, spaces, and punctuation marks.
